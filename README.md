# hikari-NES
NES emulator with extensive support for a relevant collection of games.
The source files pertaining this emulator for the purpose of this repo are designated for educational purposes only. I do not authorize commercial usage of of any type over this project. Obviously, Nintendo could use this source for commercial purposes if they ever wished to.

 
No makefile is provided but core components (PPU, Mappers, CPU/APU, RAM) are implemented to a satisfactory extent.
This will not compile without prior work, and i do not encourage compilation attempts unless it involves fair use or educational use.
